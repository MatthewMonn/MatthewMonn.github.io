Hi, I’m Matthew Monn, a junior Computer Science student at Kutztown University passionate about cybersecurity, software development, and ethical hacking. Currently, I’m expanding my expertise in penetration testing and web security, working with tools like TryHackMe to get hands on experience. 

I have experience in Python, C++, Java, MySQL, and Assembly. I'm actively working on personal and classroom projects, with TryHackMe cybersecurity training on the side. I am passonate in increasing awareness on fundamental cybersecurity principles to protect those from preventable vulnerabilites. 

I've worked with a vast amount of cybersecruity tools. Including but not limited to Burp Suite (Community and Professional), Magisk android rooting tool, Frida tools, Gobuster, Metasploit, and Nmap. I have applied these tools in TryHackMe settings, and professional settings as a cybersecurity developer intern at Thread Bioscience. 

I have the pleasure of joining the Gateway Ticketing Team this summer 2025 as a software development intern! I'm exceptionally excitied to share my passions with those who want to learn more about developing and cybersecurity!
